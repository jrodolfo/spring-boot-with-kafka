# Kafka Spring Boot Application

The majority of the code from this project was taken from this guide:

    How to Work with Apache Kafka in Your Spring Boot Application, by Igor Kosandyak, on November 1, 2018
    https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-spring-boot-application

However, the prerequisites that the author mentioned, "Confluent Platform" and "Manual install using ZIP and TAR archives"
do not apply. See the file doc/kafka-on-windows.txt to learn how to install Kafka on Windows and make it work, so that 
this app can be tested.
